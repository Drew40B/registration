## Notes
### Test Projects
At times it makes more sence to do functional tests versus pure unit tests. Thus in a a project that hase both functional and unit tests they will be separated into folders. Some may argue that this is not "pure" unit tests and I agree. I try to take a more realistic approach to testing.
